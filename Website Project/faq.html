  <div class="question">What is DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports) and how does it work?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    DFS, or Daily Fantasy Sports, is an online game where participants create virtual teams composed of real players from various sports leagues, such as the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL. Players are assigned a salary, and participants must stay within a budget while selecting their lineup. The performance of real players in actual games determines the participants' scores, with points earned based on their statistics like touchdowns, assists, and goals. At the end of the day or week, participants with the highest total points win cash prizes or other rewards.

  <div class="question">How can I improve my DFS skills and strategy</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Improving your DFS skills and strategy takes time and dedication. Here are some tips to help you get started:

a. Research Players and Matchups: Stay informed about player injuries, team dynamics, and upcoming matchups to make informed decisions.

b. Bankroll Management: Set a budget for each contest and avoid risking too much of your bankroll on a single entry.

c. Diversify Lineups: Instead of entering multiple lineups with similar players, diversify your selections to maximize your chances of success.

d. Use Analytics and Tools: Leverage DFS tools, projections, and statistics available on various websites to aid your decision-making process.
